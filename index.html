						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						<p>
							This website was created to serve as a static
							gallery of projects that I have created or
							contributed to significantly. It is also intended to
							"kill two birds with one stone", and provide the
							opportunity for you to learn a bit about my
							background as a growing software engineer.
						</p>
						<h3>Execution</h3>
						<p>
							This website was created using a majority of
							<i>pure</i> HTML5 and CSS, with a little javascript
							sprinkled in for some flare. All code is viewable
							through your browser developer tools, as well as on
							my
							<a
								href="http://github.com/thereelrg/thereelrg.github.io"
								>GitHub</a
							>. A majority of the typography is the
							<a
								href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit?query=kanit"
								>Kanit</a
							>
							font, while the main titles ("About", "Projects",
							"Stack") are in the
							<a
								href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+80s+Fade?query=rubik+80"
								>Rubik 80's Fade</a
							>
							font.
						</p>
						<h3>Inspiration</h3>
						<p>
							The style of this website was inspired by my
							interest in the neo-brutalism UI design style. I
							tried to stick with a muted RGB colour pallette,
							while including some elements that are common in
							software development.

						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						<p>
							This web application was created to serve as a
							globally availble, and accessible platform to access
							everything that has to do with Team McNamara, a
							men's curling team from Ottawa, ON.
							<span
								id="team-mcnamara-purpose-content"
								style="display: none"
								>Prior to the development of this website,
								information about the team was only available
								through Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram
								profiles, which limited viewship to those that
								had accounts on the appropriate platform. This
								application also opens the door to experiment
								and develop novel solutions to enhance the
								viewing experience for the amateur-level of
								play. Notably, it provides a way to seemlessly
								watch a live stream (from YouTube or Facebook),
								while seeing the linescores on the same screen.
								This functionality was previously only available
								when a game has been professionally streamed, or
								if it was streamed through a third-party
								service, such as OBS, and constantly monitored
								by a moderator.</span

						</p>
						<h3>Execution</h3>
						<p>
							This website was created using the React framework
							as a foundation, with Material UI elements for the
							front-end. Google Firestore and Analytics are used
							throughout the application to provide real-time data
							to the user and analytics information for
							performance monitoring.
							<span
								id="team-mcnamara-execution-content"
								style="display: none"
								>The theming that is used throughout the
								application was made to coincide with the
								overall branding of the team that has already
								been established, however, it was implemented in
								such a way as to be easily modifiable if the
								need arises.</span

							</button>
						</p>
						<h3>Inspiration</h3>
						<p>
							The inspiration of this application came from my
							first-hand knowledge of the inadequecies with the
							current landscape of curling websites and platforms,
							and the possibilities to grow the viewer base. The
							intention with this narrow-scope applicaiton is to
							expand the functionalities to a point that numerous
							teams can utilize the platform and grow the audience
							of the sport.

						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						<p>
							This project was developed as part of my fourth-year
							capstone project, with a group of 3 individuals. The
							application was designed and intended to improve
							vital tracking for wilderness first responders. The
							current method for recording and tracking vitals in
							an emergency situation in the wilderness is a pen
							and paper (a standardized form, if available). This
							method has obvious inherent flaws that can make the
							process of tracking vitals a hinderance to the care
							that needs to be provided to the wounded and sick.
						</p>
						<h3>Execution</h3>
						<p>
							The application was built using React Native for a
							seamless development process for both Android and
							iOS platforms. MongoDB / MongoDB Realm was the
							selected choice as a database and authentication
							provider. The application provides tools to aid with
							vital tracking such as: a standardized workflow to
							guide the user through the basic set of vitals,
							custom remiders to retake a vital and, timers to
							assist in recording time-based vitals such as pulse
							or respiration.
							<span
								id="wilderness-survival-purpose-content"
								style="display: none"
								>In addition, the app processes data for a
								patient into interactive graphs that can help
								visualize trends in a patient's vitals as well
								as identify changes that may not be obvious to
								the responder. Static resources are also
								available in the application to help a user
								prepare for a wilderness adventure with items
								such as: checklists to ensure all appropriate
								equipment is packed, how-to guides to ensure
								caretaking procedures are up-to-date, and a
								small wilderness survival encyclopedia to be
								used as reference when providing care. Patient
								data is also able to be exported to a PDF to be
								shared with secondary responders such as
								paramedics or medical transport personnel. The
								application and all of it's functionalities are
								available to the user "out-of-the-box", however,
								if the user wishes to save their data for use
								accross multiple devices, they are able to setup
								an account at any time.</span

							</button>
						</p>
						<h3>Inspiration</h3>
						<p>
							The inspiration for the development of this
							applicaiton came from the identification of the
							flaws and "old-school" practices that are in place
							for wilderness survival. While these practices are
							tried and tested, they can always be improved, and
							in some cases, are in desperate need of a
							refinement.

						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						<p>
							This application was created with a team of 2
							members for a final project in a database management
							course during my undergrad. The intention was to
							have an application that allows users to manage and
							peruse a library of books. The application also
							required that users with admin privileges are able
							to modify and update the stock and availability of
							books as necessary.
						</p>
						<h3>Execution</h3>
						<p>
							The application was developed largely using the Java
							Swing library for front-end (GUI) development, and a
							PostgreSQL database as the data storage solution. It
							featured screens for customers to peruse the
							available books, add them to a cart, complete
							billing and shipping information, and "complete" an
							order (this was not actually functional because that
							wasn't the point, but the foundation is there). For
							the administrators, the application has the
							functionality to modify all aspects of the books,
							view purchasing reports, order more books, and
							fulfill customer orders.
